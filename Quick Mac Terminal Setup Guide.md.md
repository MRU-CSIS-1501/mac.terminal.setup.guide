# Quick Mac Terminal Setup Guide

**Note:** I don't have a Mac available to use, so these are coming from memory:

1. Open up the Terminal app.
2. At the prompt, enter `ssh [username]@ins.mtroyal.ca`
    * For example, if your username was jbond007, then the full command would be `ssh jbond007@ins.mtroyal.ca`
 3. If you are prompted about an issue with a security key, and are asked something like "Are you sure you want to continue?", you should answer `yes`.
 4. You can then type in your mymru password - you won't see the cursor move, which might feel a bit weird, but it's perfectly fine.
 
 Macs don't have a Alt key (which is sucky for Emacs)...but don't despair! There is a way around this roadblock - check out section 3.3 (MacOS) in this document:
